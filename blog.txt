Hypocracy of the 21st century


Have you ever thought about the hypocracy which the world is showing on a daily basis and does not even realise and have you ever thought that you might be one of the hypocrites. Being a hypocritic doesnt mean that you are not a good person but what it may mean is that you cant always be trusted,(always) which I dont think any normal person want to become like. 
Well, the thing is that it can be a common thing which you may not even notice, but lets take a look at some things that I'm sure you guys will agree on with me and then let just see maybe you're one of them 

But one important thing, you cant really judge anyone's character wether if he's a hypocrite, its just a normal thing nowadays 
Let's see:


1. Motivational videos on youtube
   
   You must have seen numerous videos on youtube about motivation, not gonna lie some are really motivational where genuine people share their own hardships and experiences which are really valuable but but.... are all of the videos helpful. 
Well I've seen weird thumbnails saying "You wont waste time on youtube again after watching this!" , this is called hypocracy my friend.
To put it simply, you are watching(if you've ever) how to not waste time on youtube, on youtube! I think it explains itself.

2. 'Standing alone' pressure

   Everyone, literally everyone knows today that what it takes to be successful in their lives, still!    
As a matter of fact, according to some science only 8% of people actually achieve their goals in their lives. Actually achieving what you really like and being satisfied with it is the real definition of success, the definition may differ from people to people. Anyways, not going off our topic. 
I think that everyone once in their lives listens to the saying that you have to work hard to achieve what you want.
